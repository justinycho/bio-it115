A place to store my bio information

Hello my name is Justin Cho, I’m 21 years old, born and raised in Washington State. I’m currently in the Year Up program studying business communications, software development skills, data analysis, and career exploration. My hope is to land a software development job at a tech company in order to be financially independent. A few traits I’d use to describe myself is that I'm able to make decisions in fast paced environments, I’m flexible, and ask clear and concise questions to colleagues. I have a basic understaning of the Korean language and I'm fluent in English.

I live by James Clear's book Atomic Habits. One of my favorite quotes from him is, “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”. Before I had joined the Year Up program it was critical that I started developing great systems/habits in order to succeed. These systems will help me through the program and my lifelong software development career.
